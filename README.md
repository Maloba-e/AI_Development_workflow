AI Model to Predict Patient Readmission Risk
ðŸ‘¥ Group Assignment Overview
We worked on building an AI system that helps hospitals predict which patients are at risk of being readmitted within 30 days after discharge. 
This can help improve patient care and reduce hospital costs.
The following are the processes that we used so as to come up with the AI based model; 
a) Data Collection 
b) Data Processing
c) Model Selection 
d) Model Training 
e) Model Evaluation 
f) Model Deployment

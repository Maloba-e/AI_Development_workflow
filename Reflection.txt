PART 1: REFLECTION
=====================

**Most Challenging Part: Model Debugging and Testing**

The toughest part was debugging and evaluating the model. While the Random Forest showed perfect accuracy (1.0), it completely failed to identify patients likely to be readmitted ("Yes" cases). This was caused by class imbalance—most patients weren’t readmitted, so the model learned to just predict “No” every time.

Other issues included:

- Missing Logistic Regression and XGBoost pipelines in the code, which blocked fair model comparisons.
- Errors in cross-validation due to unsupported parameters.
- Basic preprocessing choices (like capping age or filling missing A1C values) that might have skewed results.
- A lack of visual tools (like ROC curves or feature importance plots) that would’ve helped diagnose issues faster.

**Why It Was Difficult:**
- The dataset was unbalanced and complex.
- Some parts of the implementation were incomplete.
- Debugging required going back and forth between code, data, and outputs.

**How to Improve:**

If more time and resources were available, I’d:

1. Balance the data using SMOTE or class weights.
2. Define and test additional models like Logistic Regression and XGBoost.
3. Use hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
4. Add visual diagnostics (confusion matrices, ROC curves).
5. Use smarter preprocessing and consult healthcare experts.
6. Integrate tools like SHAP or LIME to explain predictions.
7. Work with domain experts and expand the dataset to improve real-world reliability.

These improvements would boost accuracy, help catch errors early, and make the model more trustworthy—especially in a healthcare context.
